This is an automatic updater for the [brave portable](https://github.com/portapps/brave-portable) installation. *NOTE* that on the first run it shows both installed versions as none, and updates them. It's a bit unnessessary but does no harm.

## Usage
1. Download the zip from the [releases](https://github.com/mirbyte/portapps-brave-updater/releases)
2. Extract & copy the contents to the folder containing "brave-portable.exe"
3. Click and run both .exe files
4. Done, you can delete the backup files if everything works as expected
